The plants are then frozen and extracted at cryogenic temperatures using hydrocarbon solvents (generally n-butane), which helps to preserve the volatile terpenes that are not only crucial for aroma and flavor, but also create the unique qualities that make strains different from one another. Pretty important stuff."
