      "name": "Budder",
      "icon": "TBudder",
      "what": "Budder is an opaque concentrate that contains a homogenous mixture of cannabinoids and terpenes and has a soft, pliable texture. The process is sometimes known as \"wax\" or \"batter\", but we call it budder because when done correctly, it has a texture similar to room-temperature butter.",
      "how": "After extraction, we whip the concentrate by hand to make an emulsion, combining the cannabinoids and terpenes similar to how you would combine oil and vinegar to make a vinaigrette. Because everything is mixed, it delivers a consistent flavor experience. Budder is also the easiest concentrate to dab because it sticks to the tool, so you can grab the right amount and easily collect it from the bottom of the jar, resulting in less waste. Budder can also be spread on a rolling paper to give a flavor and potency punch to your favorite flower.",
      "why": "Deep, consistent flavor and mouthfeel combined with ease of use makes budder a superb choice for newer users and connoisseurs alike. It also stores very well – even if the exterior dries out slightly, the inside remains terpy and delicious.",

      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Sauce",
      "icon": "TSauce",
      "what": "With small THCA crystals floating in a terpene-rich liquid, sauce is perhaps the most popular overall texture for live resin products and delivers an incredible flavor punch and a very strong aroma. The texture is semi-liquid and greasy, so occasionally it can be difficult to manipulate and apply with the tool, but it offers a great balance of potency and flavor.",
      "how": "Sauce is made in a process similar to diamonds, where a solution is allowed to separate into THCA crystals and terpene sauce. Sauce has a smaller crystal size and the terpenes and crystals are combined for final packaging, delivering a fairly homogenous and reliable experience between budder and diamonds.",
      "why": "Follow your nose! Sauce is incredibly aromatic and allows you to choose your own mix of THCA crystals and flavorful sauce to customize your dabbing experience. Because of its texture, sauce is an “exposed” product (unlike budder and shatter which are more encapsulated), so storing it in cold temperatures helps to preserve the especially volatile terpenes.",

    },
    {
      "name": "Sugar",
      "icon": "TSugar",
      "what": "With a texture similar to soft brown sugar, this texture is generally higher potency than sauce due to having less terpene content. It is easy to use because of its less oily texture and offers a great balance of flavor and potency. ",
      "how": "Similar to sauce and diamonds, sugar is made by allowing the THCA crystals to separate from the terpene sauce and then combining them by stirring. Because cannabis strains have different terpene content, sugar is generally produced from cannabis varietals which have a lower terpene and higher THCA content. ",
      "why": "Sugar, like budder, offers a consistent experience in each dab, so you always get the balance of flavor and potency that nature intended. Sugar’s dry and non-sticky qualities and its potent nature make it easy to mix into flower for a major upgrade to your usual joint experience.",

    },
    {
      "name": "Diamonds",
      "icon": "TDiamonds",
      "what": "Unlike the other crystalline textures, which produce smaller-grain, sandy crystals, our diamond process results in large, faceted THCA crystals floating in a golden, extremely fluid terpene sauce. Diamonds give users the ability to consume almost entirely THCA for maximum potency or consume entirely sauce for maximum flavor.",
      "how": "The concentrate solution is allowed to separate very slowly and form natural THCA crystals, in a process that can take up to 8 weeks to complete. Because the process moves slow and intentionally, the crystals that result can exceed 1 gram in size. For final packaging, the fully-formed THCA crystals are combined with the terpene sauce at the ratio they produced naturally to ensure the right balance of potency and flavor in each strain.",
      "why": "A true feast for the senses, diamonds are both beautiful to look at, aromatic, and very potent. Like sauce, you can choose the mixture of your dab to get more potency or more flavor. Adding crushed diamonds to a joint provides the ultimate potency increase with just the right amount of flavor.",

    {
      "name": "THCa Chrystalline",
      "icon": "TThca",
      "what": "Pure THCA crystalline is grown using the same process as diamonds, and then we take it one step further by filtering or washing away the vast majority of terpenes, leaving behind 95%+ THCA with a clean, light flavor and ultimate potency.",
      "how": "After separation during the diamond process, the THCA crystals are collected and packaged on their own, with just a small amount of terpenes to provide a flavor punch.",
      "why": "THCA crystalline is the clear choice for the absolute highest potency. Crystalline can easily be added to a joint mixture for the ultimate in flower-plus-concentrate potency experience. Unlike many THCA products, Live Resin Project THCA Crystalline is exclusively made from high-quality fresh-frozen plants for the best formation and flavor.",

      "name": "Shatter",
      "icon": "TShatter",
      "what": "We invented live resin back in 2013, when we lived by the phrase, “If it don’t shatter, it don’t matter.” This is the original live resin texture, and this time capsule product can take you all the way back to how we first created this unique product. ",
      "how": "For the shatter process, the concentrate solution is laid flat on a sheet of parchment paper during purging, which results in a transparent golden product with a texture that can range from a hard candy to a tacky honey. In the scientific community, we call this type of solution a \"concrete.\"",
      "why": "Shatter (otherwise known as sap) is perhaps best for more experienced concentrate users, as it has a sticky texture that can be difficult to work with at times. But the long-term storage potential and the homogenous experience gives a top-flight user experience. Note: Shatter/sap needs to be stored cold to prevent degradation and nucleation which leads to sugaring.",

      "how": "We make one change to our finishing process to keep our live resin in an oil format, enabling it to be put into 510 cartridges or pod systems. There is no separation or recombination required, which differentiates our process from many other vape products that claim to be live resin.",
      "why": "Our live resin vape gives you the deeply flavorful concentrate experience you expect from our raw concentrate products, delivered in the most convenient and ubiquitous format. Utilizing a multi-temperature button battery lets allows the user to dial in the perfect balance of flavor and potency to tailor the experience.",

    {
      "q": "What strains will be available from Live Resin Project?",
      "a": "Live Resin Project will continuously source new and exciting strains to craft into our concentrates. Each of our products provide the strain name and terpene profile directly on the package to help you understand more about what you're consuming."
    },
    {
      "q": "What is the shelf life of your products?",
      "a": "The expiration date is set to one year after production date, primarily for regulatory reasons. Depending on how the product is stored (see below), it can retain its aroma and flavor at a high level for even longer than that and will remain safe to consume."
    },
    {
      "q": "How do I store Live Resin Project?",
      "a": "We recommend refrigerated or cool room temperature storage of the product to maximize the flavor and aroma over time. A great example of the ideal live resin storage climate is a wine cellar -- you want it to stay cool and remain dry. Live resin products can actually be \"cold cured\" to create additional nuance in flavor.\n\nNote: Air and light exposure are the primary causes of aroma/flavor degradation. Though our gram containers are airtight, it is suggested to keep them within another airtight container in case the lid is left slightly ajar, etc."
    },
    {
      "q": "What’s the best way to consume Live Resin Project?",
      "a": "Raw concentrates can be consumed using a range of vaporization devices and certain textures can also be added to flower for additional flavor and potency. Our recommended device categories for consuming live resin include: glass rigs (water pipe + quartz nail), portable electronic rigs (i.e. PuffCo Peak, Focus V Carta), \"load-your-own\" concentrate pens, and \"nectar collector\". Regardless of device, temperature is very important to creating the experience: low temperatures preserve terpenes and create a vapor with more flavor, higher temperatures create a vapor with higher potency."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why is temperature important?",
      "a": "When a live resin concentrate is consumed by heating, the amount of THCA in the product that is converted into active THC is dependent on the temperature of the vaporization device. A higher temperature creates more THCA to THC conversion, which means additional potency."
    },
    {
      "q": "Why does Live Resin Project cost more than other similar products?",
      "a": "To create our products, we use the finest input material by sourcing high-quality frozen plants that have been grown, harvested, and handled with care. Often, this comes at a higher cost. We then apply our industry-leading extraction and finishing processes to create the best products in each format. The quality of a concentrate can be judged by its aroma, flavor, color, and potency -- we believe that there truly aren't many concentrates on the market that we could call \"similar\"."
    },
    {
      "q": "What extraction method do you use?",
      "a": "Our products are extracted with 100% n-butane, which has been redistilled in-house in order to ensure the highest purity. Unlike many operators, we use solely n-butane (as opposed to gas blends which often incorporate propane and other solvents) because it is incredibly selective at low temperatures especially and isolates ONLY the compounds we want, leaving behind everything we don't."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is butane extraction safe?",
      "a": "Our extractions are performed inside fully compliant laboratory environment, equipped with industry-leading safety and quality standards. Under no circumstances should hydrocarbon concentrates be made anywhere other than a facility of this level. Further, our products are tested for residual solvents, pesticides, mycotoxins, and microbial contamination in addition to their cannabinoid and terpene content to give customers full transparency about what they are consuming."
    },
    {
      "q": "Is this a distillate product?",
      "a": "Live Resin Project does not utilize distillate for any of our products. While distillate has its place for providing base THC or CBD content in products such as edibles, topicals, and tinctures, it is counter to our goal of showcasing the uniqueness of the cannabis plant and delivering aromatic, flavorful, whole plant, multi-cannabinoid, multi-compound concentrates."
    },
    {
      "q": "Do you use synthetic terpenes?",
      "a": "Absolutely not. All Live Resin Project concentrates are 100% cannabis, with no flavorings, cutting agents, or added ingredients. Synthetic and botanical terpene blends do a very poor job of recreating the aroma/flavor profile of cannabis plants because the flavor of cannabis is composed of a wide variety of compounds, not simply terpenes. Flavonoids, phenols, and other compounds that are present in a true whole plant extraction are simply not there in a more refined product,"
    },
    {
      "q": "Where can I find out more information about Live Resin Project?",
      "a": "Instagram: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/liveresinproject/\">@liveresinproject</a>\nWebsite: <a target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://liveresinproject.com/\">liveresinproject.com</a>\nFacebook: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LiveResinProject/\">@LiveResinProject</a>"
