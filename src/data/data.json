      "name": "Budder",
      "icon": "TBudder",
      "what": "Budder is an opaque concentrate that contains a homogenous mixture of cannabinoids and terpenes and has a soft, pliable texture. The process is sometimes known as \"wax\" or \"batter\", but we call it budder because when done correctly, it has a texture similar to room-temperature butter.",
      "how": "After extraction, we whip the concentrate by hand to make an emulsion, combining the cannabinoids and terpenes similar to how you would combine oil and vinegar to make a vinaigrette. Because everything is mixed, it delivers a consistent flavor experience. Budder is also the easiest concentrate to dab because it sticks to the tool, so you can grab the right amount and easily collect it from the bottom of the jar, resulting in less waste. Budder can also be spread on a rolling paper to give a flavor and potency punch to your favorite flower.",
      "why": "Deep, consistent flavor and mouthfeel combined with ease of use makes budder a superb choice for newer users and connoisseurs alike. It also stores very well – even if the exterior dries out slightly, the inside remains terpy and delicious.",

      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Sauce",
      "icon": "TSauce",
      "what": "With small THCA crystals floating in a terpene-rich liquid, sauce is perhaps the most popular overall texture for live resin products and delivers an incredible flavor punch and a very strong aroma. The texture is semi-liquid and greasy, so occasionally it can be difficult to manipulate and apply with the tool, but it offers a great balance of potency and flavor.",
      "how": "Sauce is made in a process similar to diamonds, where a solution is allowed to separate into THCA crystals and terpene sauce. Sauce has a smaller crystal size and the terpenes and crystals are combined for final packaging, delivering a fairly homogenous and reliable experience between budder and diamonds.",
      "why": "Follow your nose! Sauce is incredibly aromatic and allows you to choose your own mix of THCA crystals and flavorful sauce to customize your dabbing experience. Because of its texture, sauce is an “exposed” product (unlike budder and shatter which are more encapsulated), so storing it in cold temperatures helps to preserve the especially volatile terpenes.",

    },
    {
      "name": "Sugar",
      "icon": "TSugar",
      "what": "With a texture similar to soft brown sugar, this texture is generally higher potency than sauce due to having less terpene content. It is easy to use because of its less oily texture and offers a great balance of flavor and potency. ",
      "how": "Similar to sauce and diamonds, sugar is made by allowing the THCA crystals to separate from the terpene sauce and then combining them by stirring. Because cannabis strains have different terpene content, sugar is generally produced from cannabis varietals which have a lower terpene and higher THCA content. ",
      "why": "Sugar, like budder, offers a consistent experience in each dab, so you always get the balance of flavor and potency that nature intended. Sugar’s dry and non-sticky qualities and its potent nature make it easy to mix into flower for a major upgrade to your usual joint experience.",

    },
    {
      "name": "Diamonds",
      "icon": "TDiamonds",
      "what": "Unlike the other crystalline textures, which produce smaller-grain, sandy crystals, our diamond process results in large, faceted THCA crystals floating in a golden, extremely fluid terpene sauce. Diamonds give users the ability to consume almost entirely THCA for maximum potency or consume entirely sauce for maximum flavor.",
      "how": "The concentrate solution is allowed to separate very slowly and form natural THCA crystals, in a process that can take up to 8 weeks to complete. Because the process moves slow and intentionally, the crystals that result can exceed 1 gram in size. For final packaging, the fully-formed THCA crystals are combined with the terpene sauce at the ratio they produced naturally to ensure the right balance of potency and flavor in each strain.",
      "why": "A true feast for the senses, diamonds are both beautiful to look at, aromatic, and very potent. Like sauce, you can choose the mixture of your dab to get more potency or more flavor. Adding crushed diamonds to a joint provides the ultimate potency increase with just the right amount of flavor.",

      "name": "THCa Chrystalline",
      "icon": "TThca",
      "what": "Pure THCA crystalline is grown using the same process as diamonds, and then we take it one step further by filtering or washing away the vast majority of terpenes, leaving behind 95%+ THCA with a clean, light flavor and ultimate potency.",
      "how": "After separation during the diamond process, the THCA crystals are collected and packaged on their own, with just a small amount of terpenes to provide a flavor punch.",
      "why": "THCA crystalline is the clear choice for the absolute highest potency. Crystalline can easily be added to a joint mixture for the ultimate in flower-plus-concentrate potency experience. Unlike many THCA products, Live Resin Project THCA Crystalline is exclusively made from high-quality fresh-frozen plants for the best formation and flavor.",

      "name": "Shatter",
      "icon": "TShatter",
      "what": "We invented live resin back in 2013, when we lived by the phrase, “If it don’t shatter, it don’t matter.” This is the original live resin texture, and this time capsule product can take you all the way back to how we first created this unique product. ",
      "how": "For the shatter process, the concentrate solution is laid flat on a sheet of parchment paper during purging, which results in a transparent golden product with a texture that can range from a hard candy to a tacky honey. In the scientific community, we call this type of solution a \"concrete.\"",
      "why": "Shatter (otherwise known as sap) is perhaps best for more experienced concentrate users, as it has a sticky texture that can be difficult to work with at times. But the long-term storage potential and the homogenous experience gives a top-flight user experience. Note: Shatter/sap needs to be stored cold to prevent degradation and nucleation which leads to sugaring.",

      "how": "We make one change to our finishing process to keep our live resin in an oil format, enabling it to be put into 510 cartridges or pod systems. There is no separation or recombination required, which differentiates our process from many other vape products that claim to be live resin.",
      "why": "Our live resin vape gives you the deeply flavorful concentrate experience you expect from our raw concentrate products, delivered in the most convenient and ubiquitous format.
